Description: This program works as described in textbook(23.5.4).
             I used Trie to store words, HashMap to store word information.
             Trie have two function: insert & search. Insert will insert word to trie. Search will return if word exist in trie.
             When output word frequency, I show them in an increasing order. Class WordFreq contains website and frequency that word happened in this website.
